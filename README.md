## Overview

Morphe (KA:MO1) is a simple, human-readable base data modeling specification designed to facilitate consistent transpilation of models into multiple programming languages.

The name represents the ancient Greek "form" or "shape", implying an ideal form or prototype from which other forms are derived. This symbolizes how declaratively modelled data is generatively transformed into code across different formats and languages.

## Specification Hierarchy

The Morphe specification system uses a hierarchical naming scheme to clearly identify different types of specifications:

### Base Specification (`KA:MO1`)
- `KA:` - Organization/context prefix
- `MO1` - Base specification identifier (Morphe version 1)
- *Example:* `KA:MO1` - The core Morphe data modeling specification

### Format Specification (`KA:MO1:YAML1`)
- Extends base specification with format identifier
- `YAML1` - Format representation identifier (YAML version 1)
- *Example:* `KA:MO1:YAML1` - The YAML format specification for Morphe

### Base Format
To rally ecosystem support around a canonical standard, specifications can define a "base format" that serves as the primary reference implementation. For Morphe, **YAML** (`KA:MO1:YAML1`) serves as the base format, providing:

- **Canonical Reference**: All examples and documentation use YAML as the primary format
- **Ecosystem Alignment**: Plugin developers can focus on YAML-first implementations
- **Interoperability**: A common format that all tools and implementations can understand
- **Developer Experience**: Consistent, human-readable syntax across the ecosystem

Other formats (Go, TypeScript, PostgreSQL) are considered transpilation targets from the base YAML format.

### Examples in Base Specification
This specification uses **YAML examples** rather than pseudo-code for the following reasons:

**Advantages of YAML Examples:**
- **Concrete Implementation**: Provides actionable, copy-pasteable examples
- **Canonical Reference**: Serves as the authoritative syntax reference
- **Developer Experience**: Immediately usable examples reduce learning curve
- **Consistency**: Aligns with the base format used across the ecosystem
- **Validation**: Real syntax can be tested and validated

**Trade-offs Considered:**
- **Format Coupling**: Examples are tied to YAML syntax, but this is mitigated by YAML being the canonical base format
- **Abstraction Level**: Less abstract than pseudo-code, but the concrete examples provide more value for implementation

Since YAML serves as Morphe's base format, using YAML examples creates a cohesive developer experience while maintaining the specification's practical utility.

### Motivation

This hierarchical naming scheme provides several benefits:
1. Clear separation between base concepts and format representations
2. Support for multiple format representations of the same base specification
3. Ability to transpile between different formats (e.g., YAML to Go, YAML to TypeScript)
4. Version tracking at each level of the specification
5. Extensibility for future formats

## Specification Features

The Morphe specification defines a comprehensive set of features that compile plugins can implement. Each plugin can document which features it supports, ensuring clarity about capabilities and limitations.

### Core Features

| Feature | Description | Spec Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Models** | Primary persisted data structures with fields, identifiers, and relationships | ‚úÖ Complete |
| **Entities** | Business data aggregation structures that reference model fields | ‚úÖ Complete |
| **Enums** | Predefined constant value sets with primitive types | ‚úÖ Complete |
| **Structures** | Standalone, non-persisted field groupings for DTOs | ‚úÖ Complete |

### Advanced Features

| Feature | Description | Spec Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **EnumFields** | Using enums as field types in models, entities, and structures | ‚úÖ Complete |
| **ModelRelationPolymorphism** | Polymorphic relationships (HasOnePoly, HasManyPoly, ForOnePoly, ForManyPoly) in models | ‚úÖ Complete |
| **EntityRelationPolymorphism** | Polymorphic relationships in entities | ‚úÖ Complete |
| **ModelRelationAliasing** | Custom relationship naming and aliasing in models | üöß In Progress |
| **EntityRelationAliasing** | Custom relationship naming and aliasing in entities | üöß In Progress |

### Plugin Implementation

Compile plugins should document their feature support using this standardized list. For example:

```yaml
# Plugin Feature Matrix
supported_features:
  - Models
  - Entities
  - Enums
  - ModelRelationPolymorphism
  - EntityRelationPolymorphism
unsupported_features:
  - ModelRelationAliasing
  - EntityRelationAliasing
  - EnumFields
  - Structures
```

This ensures users understand exactly what functionality is available when using specific plugins.

## Motivation

As your application's codebase grows, structural changes become increasingly expensive. 

Let's take something as simple as adding a `country` field to addresses managed by your application. To achieve this across the stack, you typically need to manually update the following things:

* `address` SQL table creation scripts
* `address` SQL queries
* Backend type definitions, such as an `Address` class
* Associated automated test arrangement and assertion blocks
* API endpoint documentation
* Front-end type definitions, such as an `Address` typescript type
* Front-end form components
* ...

Tooling exists to reduce the manual work needed for some of these steps. Common examples might be an ORM that generates SQL scripts automatically from backend types or GraphQL typescript type generators from GraphQL query files. But these tools are fragmented and tend to leverage multiple disparate "sources of truth" across your application.

The Morphe specification aims to provide a simple schema for automatically updating your code artifacts across technologies, eliminating human error, and accelerating development velocity. 

By consolidating your application's data structures into a single source of truth for your entire stack, you only have to touch one place instead of many and let your selected plugins handle the rest.

## Field Types

### Atomic Field Types

Atomic field types are type primitives that represent a single, indivisible unit of data required for defining fields on higher-order data structures.

* `UUID`: A RFC-4122 compatible UUID string
* `AutoIncrement`: A classic numeric, auto-incrementable record ID
* `String`: A variable-length string
* `Integer`: A numeric value for zero, whole numbers, and their negative counterparts
* `Float`: A numeric floating-point decimal value
* `Boolean`: A boolean (true / false) value
* `Time`: A timestamp value with a UTC offset
* `Date`: A timestamp value as a date with a UTC offset and zero time values
* `Protected`: An encryptable and decryptable value for sensitive information such as API keys
* `Sealed`: A hashable value that can not be decrypted (typically passwords)

### Enumeration Field Types

Enums can be used as field types within models, entities, and structures by referencing their name. When used as a field type, the enum enforces that only predefined values from the enum's entries can be assigned to that field.

*Example:* Using `Nationality` enum as a field type

```yaml
name: Person
fields:
  ID:
    type: AutoIncrement
  FirstName:
    type: String
  LastName:
    type: String
  Nationality:
    type: Nationality  # References the Nationality enum
```

See the [Enums](#enums) section for complete enum definition syntax and examples.

## Structures

Structures represent standalone, reusable, non-persisted groupings of fields, for more flexible use inside of application projects, for example as subtypes or DTOs (data-transfer-objects).

Each structure consists of a `name`, and a set of `fields`.

**Note:** Unlike models, structures do not have relationships or identifiers, as they are not persisted.

*Example:* `address.str`

```yaml
name: Address
fields:
  Street:
    type: String
  HouseNr:
    type: String
  ZipCode:
    type: String
  City:
    type: String
```

## Enums

Enums are predefined sets of constant values that can be used as types for fields within models, entities, and structures. They enforce consistency by limiting possible values to a fixed set.

Each enum consists of a `name`, a primitive `type` (`String`, `Integer`, `Float`), and a set of `entries`. Entries are defined as symbol names with an associated primitive representation.

*Example:* `nationality.enum`

```yaml
name: Nationality
type: String
entries:
  US: 'American'
  DE: 'German'
  FR: 'French'
```

*Example:* `universal-number.enum`

```yaml
name: UniversalNumber
type: Float
entries:
  Pi: 3.1415926535
  Euler: 2.7182818285
```

### Enum Usage

Enums can be used in three ways:

1. **As Field Types**: Reference the enum name as a field type (see [Enumeration Field Types](#enumeration-field-types))
2. **Data Validation**: Ensure only valid values are assigned to fields
3. **Code Generation**: Generate constants, types, or lookup tables in target languages

## Models

Models are the primary persisted data structures. They are somewhat analogous to relational SQL tables.

Each model consists of a `name`, a set of `fields`, a set of `identifiers`, and `related` models.

*Example:* `person.mod`

```yaml
name: Person
fields:
  ID:
    type: AutoIncrement
    attributes:
      - mandatory
  FirstName:
    type: String
  LastName:
    type: String
  Nationality:
    type: Nationality
identifiers:
  primary: ID
  name:
    - FirstName
    - LastName
related:
  ContactInfo:
    type: HasOne
  Company:
    type: ForOne
```

### Model Fields

Denoted by the `fields:` key, the model fields are specified as a uniquely named key and the finer-grained field configuration.

Each field has exactly one type.

Each field may have a list of unconstrained, lower, snake-case attributes. Attributes have no inherent meaning to the Morphe specification but may be required by specific transpiling implementations.

### Identifiers

Denoted by the `identifiers:` key, this section always requires a `primary:` identifier with a corresponding field name.

Composite or secondary identifier groups can be added with a unique key (i.e. `addr:`), and a list of relevant fields.

### Related

Denoted by the `related:` key, this section lists all related models. This means both dependencies and dependents (prerequisites).

Each relationship is characterized by an ownership and a cardinality that differentiates between 1 and n related entities.

#### Supported Ownership Values

* `For`: The current model is "for" related models, when the current model is a dependent on the existence of related models.
  * *Example:* "Address ForOne User": Address is reliant on the existence of a specified User, because Address explicitly references User identifiers.
* `Has`: The current model "has" related models, when the current model is required by the related models.
  * *Example:* "Address HasMany Document": Address supports the reliance of Documents on the existence of specified Addresses, because Documents explicitly reference Address identifiers.

#### Supported Cardinality Values

* `One`: Relationships have a cardinality of one, when the current model's relationship supports one related model instance.
  * *Example:* "Address ForOne User": Address is related to one user.
* `Many`: Relationships have a cardinality of many, when the current model's relationship supports a variable number of related model instances.
  * *Example:* "Owner HasMany Address": Owner is related to many addresses.

### Polymorphic Relationships

Polymorphic relationships allow models to be related to multiple different model types through a single association. Morphe supports four types of polymorphic relationships:

#### HasOnePoly and HasManyPoly (with `through`)

These relationships indicate that the current model "has" related models through a polymorphic interface.

- `HasOnePoly`: One-to-one polymorphic relationship
- `HasManyPoly`: One-to-many polymorphic relationship  
- `through`: Specifies the polymorphic interface name

*Example:* `person.mod` with polymorphic relationships

```yaml
name: Person
fields:
  ID:
    type: AutoIncrement
    attributes:
      - mandatory
  FirstName:
    type: String
  LastName:
    type: String
identifiers:
  primary: ID
related:
  Comment:
    type: HasOnePoly
    through: Commentable
  Tag:
    type: HasManyPoly
    through: Taggable
```

#### ForOnePoly and ForManyPoly (with `for`)

These relationships indicate that the current model belongs to one or many of the specified model types.

- `ForOnePoly`: Many-to-one polymorphic relationship
- `ForManyPoly`: Many-to-many polymorphic relationship
- `for`: Specifies the list of possible target model types

*Example:* `comment.mod` with polymorphic relationship

```yaml
name: Comment
fields:
  ID:
    type: AutoIncrement
    attributes:
      - mandatory
  Content:
    type: String
  CreatedAt:
    type: String
identifiers:
  primary: ID
related:
  Commentable:
    type: ForOnePoly
    for:
      - Person
      - Company
```

*Example:* `tag.mod` with polymorphic relationship

```yaml
name: Tag
fields:
  ID:
    type: AutoIncrement
    attributes:
      - mandatory
  Name:
    type: String
  Color:
    type: String
identifiers:
  primary: ID
related:
  Taggable:
    type: ForManyPoly
    for:
      - Person
      - Company
```

## Entities

Entities are indirect data structures that route internally to model field subsets for business data flattening and aggregation. They are analogous to SQL views, decoupling domain data from underlying technical data structures (Models).

Entities consist of a `name`, a set of `fields`, `identifiers`, and related `entities`. Identifiers and field types are inherited from models.

*Example:* `person.ent`

```yaml
name: Person
fields:
  ID:
    type: Person.ID
    attributes:
      - immutable
      - mandatory
  LastName:
    type: Person.LastName
  Nationality:
    type: Person.Nationality
  Email:
    type: Person.ContactInfo.Email
identifiers:
  primary: ID
related:
  Company:
    type: ForOne
```

### Entity Fields

Denoted by the `fields:` key, the entity fields are specified as a uniquely named key (example: `Street:`) and the finer-grained field configuration.

Each field may have a list of unconstrained, lower, snake-case (*Example:* `- immutable`, `- mandatory`) attributes. Attributes may be required by specific transpiling implementations, but have no inherent meaning to the Morphe specification itself.

### Entity Identifiers

Denoted by the `identifiers:` key, this section specifies how the entity can be uniquely identified. Entity identification strategies will be expanded in future versions to support various approaches like virtual/composite keys, hierarchical IDs, and surrogate bridging.

Currently, entity identification supports globally unique IDs from a single referenced model field.

#### Indirected Types

Entity field types are indirected model field paths. The path begins with a root model (*Example:* `type: User.Address.Street` -> `User` as the "root model"), and includes related models, terminating in a field of the last related model name. The field inherits the type from the terminal model.

### Related

Denoted by the `related:` key, this section lists all related entities. This means both dependencies and dependents (prerequisites). 

Each relationship is characterized by an `ownership` and a `cardinality` that differentiates between `1` and `n` related entities.

#### Supported Ownership Values

* `For`: The current entity is dependent on related entities.
  * *Example:* "Address ForOne User": Address is reliant on the existence of a specified User, because Address explicitly references User identifiers.
* `Has`: The current entity is required by related entities.
  * *Example:* "Address HasMany Document": Address supports the reliance of Documents on the existence of specified Addresses, because Documents explicitly reference Address identifiers.

#### Supported Cardinality Values

* `One`: The relationship supports one related entity instance.
  * *Example:* "Address ForOne User": Address is related to one user.
* `Many`: The relationship supports multiple related entity instances.
  * *Example:* "Owner HasMany Address": Owner is related to many addresses.

### Polymorphic Relationships

Entities support the same polymorphic relationship types as models, allowing them to represent complex business relationships across multiple entity types.

#### HasOnePoly and HasManyPoly (with `through`)

*Example:* `person.ent` with polymorphic relationships

```yaml
name: Person
fields:
  ID:
    type: Person.ID
    attributes:
      - immutable
      - mandatory
  LastName:
    type: Person.LastName
  Nationality:
    type: Person.Nationality
identifiers:
  primary: ID
related:
  Comment:
    type: HasOnePoly
    through: Commentable
  Tag:
    type: HasManyPoly
    through: Taggable
```

#### ForOnePoly and ForManyPoly (with `for`)

*Example:* `comment.ent` with polymorphic relationship

```yaml
name: Comment
fields:
  ID:
    type: Comment.ID
    attributes:
      - immutable
      - mandatory
  Content:
    type: Comment.Content
  CreatedAt:
    type: Comment.CreatedAt
identifiers:
  primary: ID
related:
  Commentable:
    type: ForOnePoly
    for:
      - Person
      - Company
```

*Example:* `tag.ent` with polymorphic relationship

```yaml
name: Tag
fields:
  ID:
    type: Tag.ID
    attributes:
      - immutable
      - mandatory
  Name:
    type: Tag.Name
  Color:
    type: Tag.Color
identifiers:
  primary: ID
related:
  Taggable:
    type: ForManyPoly
    for:
      - Person
      - Company
```
